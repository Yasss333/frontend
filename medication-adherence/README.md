 Project Overview
A React-based front-end application created with Create React App. It includes:

Live-reloading development environment via npm start

Configuration-ready scripts for testing, building, and deployment

TypeScript support built in

Perfect as a foundation for UI/UX-focused interview demos.

 Available Scripts
In the project directory, run:

npm start
· Starts the development server
· Opens the app at http://localhost:3000
· Enables hot-reloading on edits

npm test
· Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode

npm run build
· Bundles the app for production into the build/ folder
· Optimizes, minifies, and adds content hashes for caching

npm run eject (one-way operation)
